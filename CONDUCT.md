Hey there!

Mintere is building the best marketing company on Earth - and you're now part of the team making that happen. Of course, to be the best marketing company on Earth, we have to create a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. To that end, this is our Code of Conduct.

Mintere's community includes people from many different backgrounds. Mintere is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation.

## TL;DR:

- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive, discriminatory, or inflammatory.
- If you encounter an issue, please mail ben@mintere.com. You can also report anonymously using this form.

## Scope
Our Code of Conduct applies not only during Mintere work hours but whenever you're representing Mintere or participating in our community.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to:
- All Mintere open source projects
- All Mintere hosted events and video calls
- All Mintere or public employee-owned social media
- All Mintere client meetings
- All interactions between Mintere clients and Mintere team members

Team members: Please remember that even your behavior outside of times when you're directly representing Mintere often reflects on our company and community. As an employee or member of Mintere, any action that violates this Code that could reflect poorly on Mintere may be treated as a violation, regardless of where it occurs.

## Values
These are the values to which people in our community should aspire.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
- Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
- Be thoughtful
- Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
- Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
  - Be charitable
  - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
  - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Unwelcome behavior

These actions are explicitly forbidden, and are grounds for immediate termination or expulsion from the community:

- insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
- discrimination based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression,
  nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background,
  race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation, any protected class, or similar personal characteristic;
- bullying or systematic harassment; and
- unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.

## Moderation & Enforcement

Please understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the Code of Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop.

This procedure only serves as a general guideline for moderation & enforcement of our community conduct.
Under all circumstances, Mintere's staff members may take any action we deem appropriate, including immediate removal from the community. Being banned from the Mintere community may also prevent you from participating in our community events, activities, or future employment.

### Employees:

Any violation of this Code of Conduct is grounds for us requiring temporary unpaid leave.
Repeated or severe offenses will be grounds for immediate termination of your employment.

### Clients: 

If you received your Master Services Agreement after December 15th, 2020, you are required to
follow this Code of Conduct and ensure your staff and representatives do so as well.
Please see your Master Services Agreement for details.

If your Master Services Agreement was offered prior to December 15th, 2020, it includes a
seperate Acceptable Conduct clause. However, we ask that you comply with our Code of Conduct as well when working with us.

Please understand that we will not restrict your ability to contact Mintere under any circumstance.
If you have any questions or concerns about our decision, please reach out to us directly.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to Mintere using the process described below.
Please do not try to publicly rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.

Mail conduct@mintere.com

- Your message will reach the Mintere Conduct Working Group.
- Reports are confidential within the Mintere Conduct Working Group.
- Should you choose to remain anonymous then the Mintere Conduct Working Group cannot notify you of the outcome of your report.
- You may contact a member of the group directly if you do not feel comfortable contacting the group as a whole. That member will then raise the issue with the Working Group as a whole, preserving the privacy of the reporter (if desired).
- If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will be recused from Working Group discussions of the report.
- The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion and sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties, and to avoid conflicts of interest.
- You should receive a response within 48 hours (likely sooner). (Should you choose to contact a single Working Group member, it may take longer to receive a response.)
- The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine what happened.
- With the permission of person reporting the incident, the Working Group may reach out to other community members for more context.
- The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:
  - Nothing.
  - A private or public warning.
  - An imposed vacation (for instance, asking someone to abstain for a week from the Slack or a GitHub project).
  - A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Hack Club spaces.
  - For employees, immediate termination or temporary unpaid leave.
  - For clients, we may find you in breach of our agreement.

The Working Group will reach out to the original reporter to let them know the decision.
Appeals to the decision may be made to the Working Group, or to any of its members directly.

Note that the goal of the Code of Conduct and the Working Group is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible.
We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion. Bannings and other forceful measures are considered
last resorts - but we may impose any reasonable consequence for violations of the Code of Conduct.

Changes to the Code of Conduct should be proposed by creating an issue or making a pull request to this document.
